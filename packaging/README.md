# Packaging Templates

This directory contains maintainer-facing packaging templates for distribution
channels that usually live in separate repositories or registries.

Current source release: `v0.2.4`

## Channels

| Channel | File | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Homebrew | `homebrew/dida.rb` | Template with macOS and Linux checksums |
| Scoop | `scoop/dida.json` | Template with Windows amd64 and arm64 checksums |
| winget | `winget/README.md` | Submission notes; manifest intentionally not generated yet |

## Update Rules

1. Publish a GitHub Release tag and confirm all archives plus `checksums.txt`
   are attached.
2. Update versions, URLs, and SHA-256 checksums in the templates.
3. Test the template in the target package manager before publishing it to an
   external tap, bucket, or manifest repository.
4. Do not add credentials, local paths, private test accounts, or release
   automation secrets here.
