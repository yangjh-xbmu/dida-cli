# Changelog

All notable changes to DidaCLI are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [v0.2.4] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- Release workflow shell lint issues are fixed for formatting, checksum generation, release notes, and npm smoke packaging.
- npm release authentication now fails with a clear registry error before GitHub release creation.

## [v0.2.3] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- Go formatting baseline now matches Linux CI `gofmt`.

## [v0.2.2] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- CI coverage for private-state checks, packaging metadata validation, release archive verification, workflow linting, cross-platform builds, Go vet, and vulnerability scanning.
- Release script tests for packaging metadata, private-state hygiene, archive shape, archive contents, and executable bits.
- npm installer offline tests for redirects, checksum matching, byte limits, retry handling, unsupported platforms, and asset parsing.

### Changed
- `dida upgrade` downloads the archive and checksum file concurrently, retries transient artifact downloads, enforces a 200 MiB artifact cap, and reports Windows deferred replacement as `status: "scheduled"`.
- The npm installer now retries transient downloads, enforces a 200 MiB response cap, and reports final download attempts in errors.
- Release workflow now builds six archives in parallel, verifies archive contents before publishing, smoke-tests the Linux binary, and skips npm publish when the package version already exists.

### Fixed
- Web API task, project, comment, column, folder, and tag commands now reject flag-like IDs before auth, API calls, or dry-run success output.
- OpenAPI and Official command wrappers now reject flag-like task and project IDs in local validation.
- Official habit check-in value parsing now rejects `NaN` and infinite values.
- Windows self-upgrade stages the replacement through a helper script instead of attempting to replace the running executable.
- Packaging and release scripts now clean temporary files on failure paths covered by the test suite.

## [v0.2.1] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- `dida upgrade` self-update command: checks GitHub Releases, downloads platform binary, verifies SHA-256, replaces executable
- `dida upgrade --check` mode for version query without install
- Download progress output on stderr during upgrade (percentage-based)
- npm auto-publish job in release workflow (publishes on tag push)
- `upgrade` registered in schema registry
- README safety note for dry-run previews, destructive confirmations, and token redaction
- Release workflow archive verification for all six build targets

### Changed
- Quick Start flow: `dida auth cookie set --token-stdin` is now primary; `--browser` is secondary
- Auth error hints now recommend `--token-stdin` instead of browser-only flow
- Interactive terminal hint when using `--token-stdin` (prompts for Ctrl+D/Ctrl+Z)
- `attachment quota` now fetches independent quota endpoints in parallel
- README install snippets now use copy-pasteable URLs and `upgrade --check` for post-install update checks
- npm installer now defaults to the GitHub Release tag that matches the npm package version

### Fixed
- Global `--json` is accepted before root `version` and `--help`
- CLI integer flags now reject trailing junk such as `--limit 10x`
- Auth commands now reject unknown flags instead of silently ignoring them
- `comment update --file` now fails validation because update does not attach files
- OpenAPI project and Official task commands now return local usage errors before auth errors
- Release workflow now validates tag checkout, checks archive contents, verifies binary version, and runs npm preflight before creating the GitHub release
- Private-state checks now cover untracked files, local DidaCLI credential filenames, common dumps, packet captures, and local absolute paths
- OpenAPI OAuth `ExchangeCode` now uses 30s timeout instead of `http.DefaultClient`
- OpenAPI OAuth error messages no longer leak raw response body (secret leakage prevention)
- Official MCP client now uses 60s timeout instead of `http.DefaultClient`
- `dida upgrade` now fails when `checksums.txt` is missing from release assets (previously skipped verification silently)
- Release notes template uses `__VER__` placeholder instead of generic `VERSION` to avoid unintended sed replacements
- Semver comparison in upgrade uses proper numeric comparison (fixes downgrade-as-upgrade bug)
- Web API client: regex patterns hoisted to package-level (avoids recompilation per call)

### Tests
- Added CLI regression tests for root global flags, auth unknown flags, comment update file rejection, strict integer parsing, and auth-before-validation ordering
- Added Web API coverage proving `AttachmentQuota` overlaps independent reads
- Upgrade integration tests: full flow mock, missing checksums failure, checksum mismatch failure
- Progress reader unit test
- config package: 0% to 83.3%
- officialmcp package: 39.9% to 85.0%
- openapi package: 49.6% to 82.7%
- model package: 62.9% to 91.0%
- auth package: 48.8% to 66.7%
- cli package: 32.3% to 37.8%
- webapi package: 80.5% to 84.2%
